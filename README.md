# AIR_QUALITY_CHECK
Project Title: Air Quality Analysis of Indian Cities using CSV Dataset


📌 Project Description (Without Website)
This project involves the exploratory data analysis of air quality across multiple Indian cities using the city_day.csv dataset. The goal is to identify the most polluted cities, understand pollutant composition, and derive insights that could help in formulating effective environmental policies.

📁 Dataset Used:
File: city_day.csv

Contains: Daily air quality readings from various Indian cities

Key Columns:

City — Name of the city

Date — Observation date

AQI — Air Quality Index

PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, etc. — Pollutant concentration levels

🔍 Objectives:
Identify the Top 5 Most Polluted Cities

Based on average AQI over the time period.

Analyze Pollutant Breakdown

Understand which pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO₂, etc.) contribute the most to poor air quality in each city.

Visualize Insights (in notebook)

Bar plots and comparison charts to make the analysis understandable and actionable.

📊 Key Findings:
Ahmedabad has the highest average AQI, indicating extremely poor air quality.

Cities like Delhi, Patna, Gurugram, and Lucknow also show alarming levels of PM2.5 and PM10.

The dominant pollutants vary from city to city, with some having high CO or SO₂ levels.





🧠 Conclusion:
This analysis highlights severe air pollution in several Indian metros. The insights derived can aid policymakers, health authorities, and citizens to take necessary precautions and long-term measures.
